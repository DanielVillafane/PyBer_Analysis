# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Create a Summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. After, create multiple visualizations for each city type. 

### Purpose
Pyber intends to get a better understanding of ride-sharing by city type, driver & riders. This data will be influential in future decsions such as expansion. 

## Results

### Overview of City Types
The bubble chart below displays the total number of rides, drivers, and the average fare by city type (urban, suburban, rural).

### Ride Counts by City Type

The box-and-whisker plot and pie chart below display ride counts by city type. The box-and-whisker plot indicates that the urban ride count data includes an outlier with 39 rides in one city. The pie chart shows that urban cities have the highest percentage of total rides with 68.4% of rides. The Suburbs are next with 26.3% total rides. Lastly, rural cities have 5.3%.

### Fare Counts by City Type
The box-and-whisker plot, pie chart, multi line graph below display fares (total numbers, dollars, and percentage). The box-and-whisker plot shows the highest dollar fares are for rides in rural cities(over $35). The pie chart shows that urban cities have the highest percentage of total fares (over 62%). The multi line graph shows total weekly fares for each city type. As expected, urbahn cities generate the highest revenue.

## Summary
Based on the data outlined abbove, here are our recommendations:
1.	Additional drivers should be added to urbahn areas.  
2.	Retreive more data: more data on the riders would  help develop a plan for repeat customers.    
3.	Create a rewards program for repeat customers. Offer things like discounted rides after evey 3 rides, or 1 free rdie a month, etc.
